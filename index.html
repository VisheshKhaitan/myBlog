        HI!

    <h2>
        A hobby is something which one loves to do in his/her leisure time.
        Different people have different hobbies.
        My favorite hobby is reading books.
        I spend my leisure time reading all types of books.
        Literature is my favorite genre. I spend most of my time in reading novels, drama and short stories.
        I have made a collection of several books.
        I have books of Shakespeare, Charles Dickens, Panchtantra, Story of Prophets, etc.
        Books make me wise and keep me away from bad company.
        I love books so much that I often forget to take my food on time.
        I am proud of my hobby.
